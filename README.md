BACKGROUND: 
IPEG is an experiment that aim to assess whether the prosocial simulation effect (PSE) (i.e., imagine helping a person will lead to an increase in willingness to help him/her) can be generalized to different targets (i.e., will imagine helping one person increase willingness to help another person in need who is in the same situation as they imagined?). For all trials, The peron participants imagined (simulation targets) were always different from the person they are asked to help (helping targets) but they may differ across sex and age. The following research questions were assess:

1. Assess whether PSE can be generalized to helping a different person in need.
2. Examine whether this generalization effect is graded across similarity betwene helping and simulation targets (e.g., will participants express a greater willingness to help the helping targets if they were the same sex and age as the simulation targets?).

IPEG_analysis.rmd contains most updated scripts for analyses in IPEG. A list of measures collected from the experiments are included in IPEG_analysis.rmd. In addition, Bayes_scripts.R and LMM_scripts.R can be found IPE_IPEF_Analysis folder.
